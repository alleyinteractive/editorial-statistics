Editorial Statistics
====================
This plugin allows editors to view total content published with the following available settings: 

1) Start Date and End Date: Set the start and end dates for the report or choose from one of four predefined date ranges.

2) Report Columns: You must choose at least one of the three columns for Author, Content Type and/or Term. If you choose more than one, the report will break down more granularly.

3) Choose Taxonomies (optional): If you choose Term as a column, you must specify which taxonomies you wish to include in the report.

Once submitted, the report will appear in an HTML table below the form. You can click the Export to CSV link to download a copy for further manipulation in Excel.
